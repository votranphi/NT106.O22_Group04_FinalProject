# Chat application - beta version

We tried to develope our application by using Socket class but there were a lot of problems during the course of our work. So that we changed our ways to make this application. We used the ideas that we used in this porject to sovle the problems in final project in main branch. 

## Description

In this project, we successfully sent the text messages but there were some problems when we sent pictures and files, and we couldn't find out the way to solve this. So we deciced to change another way to make this application. But that doesn't mean we don't use anythings in this project. There are so many ideas that we can bring from this project to the final one such as send file, picture,... So this is still an important project that we put a lot of enthusiasm in.
